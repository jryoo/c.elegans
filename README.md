C. elegans
=========

Caenorhabditis elegans is a transparant nematode about 1mm in length. It holds particular importance in biology because it was the first multicellular organism to have its genome completely sequenced. It is also the only organism to have had its entire connectome (neural wiring) mapped.

Because the behavior of C. elegans is somewhat predictable, this project aims to virtually replicate the behavior first by creating a simple biased random walk worm and ultimately creating a complete virtual connectome that reacts to its environment.

The goal of this project is to see if it is possible to completely replicate the behavior of this worm through code.
